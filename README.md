This project aims to develop a robust Task Management API with advanced features to facilitate comprehensive task management workflows. It supports real-time notifications, task dependencies, and high-level security measures to protect user data. Key features include the ability to manage various types of tasks (e.g., Improvements, Features, Bugs), handle task dependencies, and generate regular performance reports. User roles, permissions, and authentication are managed to ensure secure access and actions within the system.
Features:

    Task Management:
        Support for various task types (e.g., Bug, Feature, Improvement).
        Advanced task filtering and search capabilities.
        Task status management with automatic updates based on dependencies.

    Task Dependencies:
        Task dependencies are tracked, with automatic status updates to "Blocked" or "Open" as needed.

    Real-time Notifications:
        Users receive instant notifications on task assignments, status changes, and comments.

    Security:
        JWT Authentication: Secure access using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
        Role-based Authorization: Control actions based on user roles.
        Rate Limiting and CSRF Protection: Prevents DDoS and CSRF attacks.
        Data Sanitization: Protection against XSS and SQL Injection.

    Enhanced Performance:
        Database Optimization: Uses caching and indexing for frequently queried tasks.
        Background Processing: Daily performance reports are handled via job queues.

    Error Logging and Handling:
        A centralized logging system captures and tracks errors for review and analysis.

    Advanced Reporting:
        API endpoints allow for the generation of various task-related reports with detailed filtering options.

    Soft Delete with Restore Option:
        Tasks can be soft-deleted and restored later without data loss.

API Endpoints:
Task Management

    Create Task: POST /api/tasks
    Update Task Status: PUT /api/tasks/{id}/status
    Reassign Task: PUT /api/tasks/{id}/reassign
    Add Comment to Task: POST /api/tasks/{id}/comments
    Add Attachment to Task: POST /api/tasks/{id}/attachments
    View Task Details: GET /api/tasks/{id}
    Advanced Task Filtering: GET /api/tasks?type=Bug&status=Open&assigned_to=2&due_date=YYYY-MM-DD&priority=High&depends_on=null
    Assign Task to User: POST /api/tasks/{id}/assign

Reporting and Dependency

    Generate Daily Task Report: GET /api/reports/daily-tasks
    View Blocked Tasks Due to Dependencies: GET /api/tasks?status=Blocked

Security and Protection

    JWT Authentication: Secures access to API endpoints by validating tokens for each request.
    Rate Limiting: Controls request rates to mitigate DDoS attacks.
    CSRF Protection: Guards against cross-site request forgery attacks.
    Data Sanitization: Filters and sanitizes user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
    Role-based Authorization: Manages user permissions based on roles to control task actions like assignments and status updates.

Models:

    Task
        Fields: title, description, type (Bug, Feature, Improvement), status (Open, In Progress, Completed, Blocked), priority (Low, Medium, High), due_date, assigned_to (User ID).
    Comment:
        Polymorphic relationship to Task to handle task comments.
    Attachment:
        Polymorphic relationship to manage file attachments.
    TaskStatusUpdate:
        Tracks changes in task status (relationship: hasMany).
    User:
        Manages users and associates them with tasks (relationship: belongsTo).
    Role:
        Manages user permissions by defining specific permissions for each user.

Advanced Features

    Task Dependencies:
        Uses a dependencies_task table to track and manage task dependencies.
        Automatically sets task status to "Blocked" if dependent tasks are incomplete.

    Automatic Reassignments:
        Tasks dependent on closed tasks automatically switch from "Blocked" to "Open" when all conditions are met.

    Performance Management:
        Uses job queues to handle high loads and manage task reports efficiently.

    File Management:
        Secures file uploads with encryption and optional virus scanning for safety.

Database Optimization

    Caching: Stores frequently accessed tasks to improve response time.
    Database Indexing: Enhances performance of search and filter queries.

Error Handling and Reporting

    Custom Exception Handling: Provides detailed error messages to users.
    Error Logging: Captures all errors within the system for later analysis.

Additional Reporting Options

    API supports generating various types of reports (e.g., completed tasks, delayed tasks, tasks by user) with advanced filtering capabilities.
